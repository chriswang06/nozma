The sum of these itemized table costs is 1,495,000 USD for Year 1, 1,662,000 USD for Year 2, and 1,764,000 USD for Year 3, aligning with the 'Total Cost' line item in the table, summing to 4,921,000 USD over three years. Additionally, a cost for 'ongoing managed services (ie dedicated TAM and detailed scope)' was provided in the RFP question responses (Question 24) at 4,200 USD/month (equating to 50,400 USD/year). Assuming this managed service is supplementary to the services itemized in the pricing table, its three-year cost of 151,200 USD is added. The total sum of costs is therefore 4,921,000 USD (from table totals) + 151,200 USD (for additional managed services), resulting in 5,072,200 USD.",
